		- The Simulation System is responsible for executing both players and enemy actions.
		- Simulation System can be run and stop at players will.
	- The game execute both the players and enemy actions in order, pairing each actions step by step.
		- For instance, lets say we have these actions for both Player and Enemy:
			- For player:
				- `slash()`
				- `stab()`
				- `parry()`
				- and so on...
			- For enemy:
				- `stab()`
				- `slash()`
				- `feint()`
				- and so on...
		- The execution order of these is(each step is executed at the same time):
			- 1st step: `slash()` (player) and `stab()` (enemy)
			- 2nd step: `stab()` (player) and `slash()` (enemy)
			- 3rd step: `parry()` (player) and `feint()` (enemy)
